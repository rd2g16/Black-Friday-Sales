# Black-Friday-Sales
Exploratory data analysis on a black friday sales dataset.

This project analyses a small dataset of Black Friday purchases paierd with demographic data from the customers. Here, I implement statistical and machine learning techniques as well as data visualisation for exploring the dataset. The features given are unable to predict the customer purchase behaviour singlehandedly, which is the reason why this project is solely focused on exploratory data analysis.

The data has been obtained from the data science website, Analytics Vidhya.

The code and documentation for all custom functions and classes used can be found in 'BFS_functions_and_classes.py'
